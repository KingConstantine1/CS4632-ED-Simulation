# Emergency Department Discrete-Event Simulation

This repository contains the semester project for CS 4632 (Modeling and Simulation).

The goal of this project is to design and implement a discrete-event simulation
that models patient flow through a hospital emergency department. The simulation
will analyze patient arrivals, queueing behavior, service times, and resource
utilization to evaluate system performance under varying conditions.

## Project Status
Milestone 1: Project Foundation (proposal, literature review, UML diagrams)

Future milestones will include implementation and experimentation.
